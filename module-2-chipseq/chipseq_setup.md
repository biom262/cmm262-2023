# Installing IGV (Integrative Genomics Viewer)

1. Navigate to the IGV [download page](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/download) and either choose download steps 1. or 2., depending if you're a Mac or Windows user (we want to have a local version). You may need to install Java if you do not have it already (follow instructions on IGV link)."
2. The download might take a few minutes so be patient
3. Unzip IGV and place it in a meaningful location (can be a CMM262 class folder but I recommend moving it to a more meaningful/accessible location)
4. Double click on the IGV executable (labelled 'igv'). In Windows the type of file is called a batch file.
5. Be patient once more. It might take 30 seconds or more for IGV to launch. You should be seeing an empty IGV screen and in the top-left corner you should see that 'Human hg19' is selected as default genome. Change the genome to 'Mouse mm9'.
